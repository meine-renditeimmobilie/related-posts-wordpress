# related-posts-wordpress
Custom code to add a metabox with all posts for selecting related posts for every given post in WordPress 

This code can go into your theme's functions.php file. As per Wordpress.org rules it should be put into a plugin instead because it alters or creates content, but does it? if you change the theme sometime in the future you can copy paste the code over into the new theme's functions.php file. The related posts selected up to this point do not get deleted by changing the theme, they'll still be there. 

Anyways, you can certainly wrap this into everything required to make it a standalone plugin instead.
